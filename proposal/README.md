### Project Proposal Template

Before you start project work for a course, you **should be able to complete the following proposal template**, addressing the questions listed as completely as possible. 
However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change 
(i.e. increase/decrease in number of samples, types of features or algorithm used, etc), so this is just a starting point.
Also, if you are unsure in some areas, you should still submit a partial proposal to receive feedback from instructors. 

In addition to submitting this plan, you may discuss the areas below with an instructor in a **scope meeting**.

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

#### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
